##A Glimpse Between Storms and Sunshine


Hurricane Donna changed the landscape and life of Naples and Collier County in 1960.This digital exhibit brings together photographs, reports, and community reflections from the Collier County Museums to show how the area faced destruction, rebuilt, and found strength in the aftermath. 
Each piece tells a part of Southwest Florida’s story. One of resilience, recovery, and enduring spirit between the storms and sunshine.
