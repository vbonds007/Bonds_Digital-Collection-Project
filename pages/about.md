## About the Collection

When Hurricane Donna tore through Southwest Florida in September 1960, it left Naples and Collier County almost unrecognizable. Winds stronger than 120 miles per hour destroyed homes, flooded neighborhoods, and knocked out power. Even with so much damage, the community came together and began to rebuild.  

This collection brings together photos, reports, and local stories from the Collier County Museums that show how the region prepared for, survived, and recovered after the storm. The items capture both the physical destruction and the strength of the people who lived through it—from flooded streets and fallen buildings to reflections about what the storm revealed about Naples’ growth and vulnerability.  

Each image and document adds to the story of how Naples handled disaster and change. Together, they preserve an important piece of local history and show how recovery is about people as much as it is about rebuilding.
