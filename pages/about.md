<h2>About the Collection</h2>

<p>When Hurricane Donna tore through Southwest Florida in September 1960, it left Naples and Collier County almost unrecognizable. Winds stronger than 120 miles per hour destroyed homes, flooded neighborhoods, and knocked out power across the region. Even with so much loss, the community came together and started to rebuild.</p>

<p>This digital exhibition brings together photographs, reports, and personal stories from the Collier County Museums to show how the region prepared for, endured, and recovered from the storm. These materials capture both the destruction and the determination, from flooded streets and collapsed buildings to reflections that reveal what the disaster exposed about Naples’ growth and resilience.</p>

<p>Together, these items preserve an important part of local history and show that recovery in Southwest Florida has always been about people as much as rebuilding.</p>

<h2>Curatorial Statement</h2>

<p>Between the Storms and Sunshine looks at the cycles of loss and renewal that shaped Collier County’s identity through the twentieth century. Each storm, from the floods of the 1920s to Hurricane Donna in 1960, shows how the area’s strength comes from the people who adapt, rebuild, and carry those memories forward.</p>
